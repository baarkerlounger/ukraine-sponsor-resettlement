      Homes for Ukraine:
    <br/>
      Register to host people already living in the UK
    </h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">Thanks to the generosity of the British people, over 100,000 people from Ukraine have arrived in the UK and are living safely in their hosts’ homes.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Many of these guests now need to find a new host while they prepare to live independently, because their original hosts are reaching the end of their 6 month commitment.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">New hosts will receive a thank-you payment of £350 a month, while their guests are staying with them.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Guests already living in the UK usually need far less support from their hosts than someone who has just landed in the UK.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Many guests have already found work and are settling into their local area, making them more self-sufficient.</p>
    <br/>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Check if being a host is right for you
    </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Hosting people from another country is a big commitment, so we’ve prepared some questions to help you decide if it’s right for you.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You'll be able to register after you've answered these questions.</p>
