    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">The UK is one of the most generous nations in the world and the British public are now being asked to go one step further and open their homes to those fleeing the war in Ukraine.</p>

  How this works
</h1>

<div class="govuk-grid-row">
  <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">This bespoke scheme offers a route to those who want to come to the UK and have someone here willing to provide them with a home. It will enable individuals, charities, community groups and businesses to volunteer accommodation and provide a route to safety for people fleeing Ukraine.</p>
    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">Sponsors should provide accommodation for as long as they are able, but we have a minimum expectation of 6 months.</p>
    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">Someone is eligible for the scheme if they are a Ukrainian national or the immediate family member of a Ukrainian national, and were resident in Ukraine prior to 1 January 2022.</p>
    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">We will welcome as many arrivals as possible, based on the number of sponsors.</p>
    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">People arriving under this scheme will be able to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Live and work in the UK for up to three years</li>
      <li>Access healthcare, benefits, employment support, education, and English language tuition</li>
    </ul>
