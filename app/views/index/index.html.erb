    <p>The UK is one of the most generous nations in the world and the British public are now being asked to go one step further and open their homes to those fleeing the war in Ukraine.</p>
    <p>We have a long history of helping others in their hour of need and the Homes for Ukraine Scheme offers a lifeline to those forced to flee their homes.</p>

  How this works
</h1>

<div class="govuk-grid-row">
  <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">This bespoke scheme will offer a route to those who want to come to the UK who have someone here willing to provide them with a home. It will enable individuals, charities, community groups and businesses to volunteer accommodation and provide a route to safety for Ukrainians, and their immediate family members, forced to escape their homeland.</p>
    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">Sponsors should provide accommodation for as long as they are able, but we have a minimum expectation of 6 months.</p>
    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">Someone is eligible for the scheme if they are a Ukrainian national or the immediate family member of a Ukrainian national, and were resident in Ukraine prior to 1 January 2022.</p>
    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">We will welcome as many arrivals as possible, based on the number of sponsors.</p>
    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">People arriving under this scheme will be able to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Live and work in the UK for up to three years</li>
      <li>Access healthcare, benefits, employment support, education, and English language tuition</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">If you donâ€™t know anyone who you wish to sponsor you may wish to get in touch with charities, faith groups or local community organisations who are starting to make connections between individuals.</p>

<div class="govuk-grid-row">
  <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">If you have a residential spare room or separate self-contained accommodation that is unoccupied then please come forward.

</h1>

<div class="govuk-grid-row">
  <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">Just accommodation. There is nothing stopping sponsors offering meals should they wish to.</p>

This will launch later this week, and if you have a named family or individual you wish to support you will be able to fill in a form requesting to sponsor them.</p>
    <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">Please see further <%= govuk_link_to 'FAQs', 'https://www.gov.uk/guidance/homes-for-ukraine-scheme-frequently-asked-questions' %> for those interested in becoming a sponsor.</p>
